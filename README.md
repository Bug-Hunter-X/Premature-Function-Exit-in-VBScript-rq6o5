This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript: a prematurely exiting function. The `bug.vbs` file contains a function that exits prematurely due to an incorrectly placed `Exit Function` statement. This can cause unexpected behavior or errors because subsequent code in the function is not executed under certain conditions. The `bugSolution.vbs` file provides a corrected version of the function, addressing the premature exit issue.
